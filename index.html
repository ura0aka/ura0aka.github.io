<h3 id="1-the-stars-up-above">1. THE STARS, UP ABOVE</h3>
<p>At the very top of the mountain, there was snow.<br>We have climbed in the night, in silence, stopping along the way to listen carefully. The whistling of the bullets, you hear it even when it&#39;s not there, even when it isn&#39;t there yet. Once you are shot at, it never stops. The same goes the other way around. What I mean by that is: we are always either on one side or the other of the muzzle of a gun.<br>It was very dark under the cover of the trees; we could not see a thing- but we also couldn&#39;t hear anything either. The silence and the dark. You do not know what it looks like, this silence, this darkness. The prelude to the chaos and the fire. The silence and the dark are inhabited by a multitude of fire breathers, ready to strike, but when? You do not see the dark, you do not hear the silence, you await the chaos and the fire, when the monsters will crawl out of their lairs.<br>War is horribly loud. You cannot hear yourself think. Although, we do not think. We react. After a while, it&#39;s as if we lay in cotton wool, the noise deafens everything, muddles everything, isolates you. We are detached from ourselves. In these moments, I feel invulnerable. It&#39;s not an illusion. I have never been seriously injured aside a few scratches here and there. I saw my blood drawn more in the kitchen than on the battlefield. And yet, I know my way around a knife. But I know my way around a weapon even more. It&#39;s a gift.<br>A path ascended winding and meandering till the very top of the cliff, but we walked alongside it, in the woods. I was at the right, with a couple of guys. The commander was on the left, along with Mistral and the giant of the unit. I was climbing. I was told to climb. I did not know what we were about to find at the top of the mountain, I wasn&#39;t told anything, and I never asked anything. I was climbing in the deafening silence, my finger on the trigger, and then suddenly there was the snow. A carpet of snow, really, it looked like a carpet, that grew thicker as it reached the peak.<br>By the way, how far was the peak? I&#39;ve had no idea and I couldn&#39;t care less. But the snow... The snow was a blessing and a curse. It was a moonless night, however only the light from the stars was able to unravel the mountain. I&#39;ve felt as though I was traversing a dream. At the same time, I knew I was visible, black silhouette on a white background. I didn&#39;t care. It was beautiful. The naked trees, the conifers dressed in black robes, the stars. I&#39;ve had snow up to my ankles, soon it reached up to midleg. The trees started spreading out and suddenly, we arrived at the summit. Before us stood an observatory. It was old, all white and encrusted with snow like a cake. It wasn&#39;t modern and that made me happy. It had useless curves- I could see that there was no concern for the waste of material when it was built. Sitting there at the top of the mountain, it looked like the scalp of a bald person pointing its head to the infinite expanse beyond.<br>From where I was, I could not see the eye of the telescope, but there was what looked like a big antenna and it seemed incongruous, sitting on the cupola like a plastic figure of a married couple on top of a wedding cake. I immediately figured out that this was our objective: a communications antenna.<br>I signaled the men to spread out, mechanically, by pure habit. It was so beautiful, so calm. We could see everything like it was day out, well almost. I love the stars, even if I don&#39;t know their names. As a child, laying in the grass, I would gaze at them, trying to make sense of the infinite cosmos.<br>There was no sign of enemy forces. Surely the commander knew what he was doing. We stayed put, waiting, ready to open fire. I had to force myself to hold my gaze in the direction of the great door that was open, on the side of the observatory, right in front of me. After a while, it opened. A man with a rifle slung over his shoulder stepped outside, he pulled out a cigarette from his pocket and struck a match. Someone from our camp opened fire way too early. The man fell and for a few minutes I watched the smoke from his cigarette swirling up. It fell in his collar and kept burning his skin.<br>After that, all hell broke loose. I don&#39;t know why they tried to leave the observatory, it was foolish because we had no casualties, only they suffered the consequences. Now they were everywhere, scattered across the snow around the building. It was dry up there. The snow was light and was sprinkling the corpses in white. Only the blood stayed vivid, like red flowers in a field of snow. The blood drank one by one the snowflakes that gently landed under the light wind and the last breaths of the fallen men. We could only see the redness of the blood under the flares shot out by the commander.<br>Our men remained carefully under the cover of the trees; they were waiting. You can&#39;t be too careful. The flare accomplished its task and goes out as its snuffed out by the snow. The blood turns to black once again. I was looking at the sky, then the ground. Up there, white spots on a black background. Down here, black spots on a white background. The light of the stars reached me millions of years from there. I saw the radiance of a dead world, inorganic and illusory.<br>In the snow too, death seemed to have an inorganic character.<br>It was then that it happened.<br>In the doorway of the observatory, a white flag was being waved around. The man that was waving the flag was cautious, he took his time to exit the building. In one hand, he held his flag (a shirt, I think, attached to a broom handle), the other, he held it high up, the palm turned towards us to show he was unarmed. He was screaming that he was surrendering, that he was not a soldier. And he started making his way towards us, slowly, without ceasing to scream he was surrendering all the while still waving his makeshift white flag.<br>He was swearing in the landscape. He was making noise. He was disturbing the inorganic order of things with his voice, his motions, the blood in his veins. I put a bullet between his eyes. He fell. The silence returned.<br>It was the first time.<br>-The first time you killed?<br>-The first time I felt like I belonged in the universe.</p>
